Shopping Cart Operations::

Objective:

In the previous chapters, we created a cart page for FlipDeal where we dealt with various API calls to calculate the cart amount based on various factors. Since, the APIs ran well, FlipDeal is now expecting to also give its customers the ability to add items to the cart, edit the quantity, delete items, and also read the current state of the cart page.

They have added some new items to their Product Listing Page:
 Laptop
 Mobile
 Tablet

Summary:
 Add items to the cart using the GET /cart/add endpoint.

 Edit the quantity of items in the cart using the GET /cart/edit endpoint.

 Delete items from the cart using the GET /cart/delete endpoint.

 Read the current state of the cart using the GET /cart endpoint.

 Calculate the total quantity of items in the cart using the GET /cart/total-quantity endpoint.

 Calculate the total price of items in the cart using the GET /cart/total-price endpoint.
